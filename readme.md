The exercise for this test case is to build out the page from the attached design. We estimate that this will take you about 1 to 2 hours. The project already includes a typescript schema. We encourage you to make use of these typings, but don't spend to much time on this if you are inexperienced with Typescript.

Design: https://xd.adobe.com/view/a8c4c2c2-cff2-48f9-9724-84917e997575-fd97/
Data endpoint: http://testcase.dev1.studiotast.com/cards

## We would like you to:

1. Fetch the data from the endpoint
2. Map over the data and render the cards in a fluid responsive grid layout
3. Build the card component. It's important that you take notice to the following:
   - Both the card & member entities have a completed state
   - The scrollbar in the member-bar should work inside the container as seen in the design. You can use the custom scrollbar that's already included in this codebase
   - There should be a tooltip on each member that displays it's name
4. Separate the completed items from the not completed items (as seen in desgin)

## You can't and won't have to:

1. Use external libraries
2. Build the navigation (side & top nav)
3. Go too far over the estimated time indication. If you want to finish outside of the time frame that is fine, but please keep track of the time you spend on the assignment.

## Setup

1. Fork the repository 
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the watch script. This will run the website on http://localhost:3000/
4. Commit the changes
5. Create a pull request back to the original repository

Break a leg!
